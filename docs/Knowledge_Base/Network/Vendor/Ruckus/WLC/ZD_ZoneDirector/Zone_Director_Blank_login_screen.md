    ### Reported Issue

    If you install an RMA'd ZD and when you login using Firefox, you get a blank page due to old running Firmware on the unit, you will need to follow the step shown below.

    This solution might not be applicable for ZD 3000, but you can it a try or you can find a another ZD 3000 currently working on another location then login, navigate to the firmware page and try that link instead.

    Example: [https://X.X.X.X/admin10/login.jsp]

    ### Issue Reason

    The reason this issue happens is that the Firmware running on the ZD is too old and you need to upgrade it to fix the problem.

    ### Important Considerations

    Before running a Firmware Upgrade, you must make sure that you established the proper Firmware version that support all Access Points at the property and then you need to establish the proper Upgrade Path.

    ### Solution

    Change the link to your ZD with the following path [https://X.X.X.X/admin10/admin_upgrade.jsp]

    The page might not look exactly like this but that doesn't matter, all you need is to click the Browse and continue with the Firmware upgrade.
