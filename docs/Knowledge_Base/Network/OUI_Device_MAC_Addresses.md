    If you want to know what type of device is connected to your Network, you can identify the device by its Physical Address (MAC Address).

    Keep in mind if the device like a Mobile Phone or Laptop has "Private Addressing" or "MAC Randomization" enabled, you most likely won't be able to tell what brand/vendor the device is.
