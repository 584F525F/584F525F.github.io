|---|---|
|**Directory or file**|**Description**|
|/|The slash / character alone denotes the root of the filesystem tree.|
|/bin|Stands for [_binaries_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) and contains certain fundamental utilities, such as ls or cp, that are needed to mount /usr, when that is a separate filesystem, or to run in one-user (administrative) mode when /usr cannot be mounted. In System V.4, this is a symlink to /usr/bin. Otherwise, it needs to be on the root filesystem itself.|
|[/boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//boot)|Contains all the files needed for successful booting process. In [Research Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix), this was one file rather than a directory.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-upe-14) Nowadays usually on the root filesystem itself, unless the system, bootloader etc. require otherwise.|
|[/dev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev)|Stands for _devices_. Contains [file representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_node) of peripheral devices and [pseudo-devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file#Pseudo-devices). See also: [Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers_Authority). Needs to be on the root filesystem itself.|
|/etc|Contains system-wide configuration files and system databases; the name stands for [_et cetera_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_cetera)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-upe-14) but now a better expansion is **e**ditable-**t**ext-**c**onfigurations. Originally also contained "dangerous maintenance utilities" such as init,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-v7-6) but these have typically been moved to /sbin or elsewhere. Needs to be on the root filesystem itself.|
|/home|Contains user home directories on Linux and some other systems. In the original version of Unix, home directories were in /usr instead.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-notes72-15) Some systems use or have used different locations still: [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) has home directories in /Users, older versions of BSD put them in /u, [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD) has /usr/home.|
|/lib|Originally _essential libraries_: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) libraries, but not [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) ones.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-upe-14) On modern systems, it contains the shared libraries needed by programs in /bin, and possibly [loadable kernel module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadable_kernel_module) or [device drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver). Linux distributions may have variants /lib32 and /lib64 for multi-architecture support.|
|/media|Default mount point for removable devices, such as USB sticks, media players, etc. By common sense, the directory itself, whose subdirectories are mountpoints, is on the root partition itself.|
|/mnt|Stands for _mount_. Empty directory commonly used by system administrators as a temporary mount point. By common sense, the directory itself, whose subdirectories are mountpoints, is on the root partition itself.|
|/opt|Contains locally installed software. Originated in [System V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V), which has a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) that installs software to this directory (one subdirectory per package).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-16)|
|/proc|[procfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs) virtual [filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system) showing information about [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) as files.|
|/root|The home directory for the [superuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) _root_ - that is, the system administrator. This account's home directory is usually on the initial filesystem, and hence not in /home (which may be a mount point for another filesystem) in case specific maintenance needs to be performed, during which other filesystems are not available. Such a case could occur, for example, if a hard disk drive suffers failures and cannot be properly mounted. By convention, this directory is on the root partition itself; in any case, it is _not_ a link to /home/root or any such thing.|
|/sbin|Stands for "[system (or superuser) binaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)" and contains fundamental utilities, such as init, usually needed to start, maintain and recover the system. Needs to be on the root partition itself.|
|/srv|Server data (data for services provided by system).|
|/sys|In some [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution), contains a [sysfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs) virtual [filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system), containing information related to hardware and the operating system. On BSD systems, commonly a symlink to the kernel sources in /usr/src/sys.|
|/tmp|A place for temporary files not expected to survive a reboot. Many systems clear this directory upon startup or use [tmpfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs) to implement it.|
|/unix|The Unix [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) in Research Unix and [System V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-upe-14) With the addition of [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) support to [3BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution#3BSD), this got renamed /vmunix.|
|/usr|The "user file system": originally the directory holding user home directories,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-notes72-15) but already by the Third Edition of [Research Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix), ca. 1973, reused to split the operating system's programs over two disks (one of them a 256K fixed-head drive) so that basic commands would either appear in /bin or /usr/bin.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-reader-17) It now holds executables, libraries, and shared resources that are not system critical, such as the [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), [window managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager), [scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language), etc. In older Unix systems, user home directories might still appear in /usr alongside directories containing programs, although by 1984 this depended on _local customs_.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-upe-14)|
|/include|Stores the development headers used throughout the system. [Header files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_file) are mostly used by the #include directive in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) language, which historically is how the name of this directory was chosen.|
|/lib|Stores the needed libraries and data files for programs stored within /usr or elsewhere.|
|/libexec|Holds programs meant to be executed by other programs rather than by users directly. E.g., the [Sendmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail) executable may be found in this directory.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-18) Not present in the FHS until 2011;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#cite_note-19) Linux distributions have traditionally moved the contents of this directory into /usr/lib, where they also resided in 4.3BSD.|
|/local|Resembles /usr in structure, but its subdirectories are used for additions not part of the operating system distribution, such as custom programs or files from a [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD) [Ports collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ports_collection). Usually has subdirectories such as /usr/local/lib or /usr/local/bin.|
|/share|Architecture-independent program data. On Linux and modern BSD derivatives, this directory has subdirectories such as man for [manpages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manpage), that used to appear directly under /usr in older versions.|
|/var|Stands for _variable_. A place for files that might change frequently - especially in size, for example e-mail sent to users on the system, or process-ID [lock files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_file).|
|/log|Contains system log files.|
|/mail|The place where all incoming mail is stored. Users (other than root) can access their own mail only. Often, this directory is a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to /var/spool/mail.|
|/spool|[Spool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spooling) directory. Contains print jobs, mail spools and other queued tasks.|
|/src|The place where the uncompiled source code of some programs is.|
|/tmp|The /var/tmp directory is a place for temporary files which should be preserved between system reboots.|
