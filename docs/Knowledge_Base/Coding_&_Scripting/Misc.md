    ### HTAs
    
    HTAs are Windows-executable, packaged HTML files that run HTML, CSS, and Windows native scripting languages from a single file outside of the context of the web browser.

    HTAs do not run in the context of the Windows web browser, but instead run as a trusted application on the operating system.
