<p>Graduated as a Software Engineer, worked as a Support Engineer for 5 years Installing Call Center solutions, configuring Windows Servers, Installing, configuring and Administering SQL Server Databases, QA [White & Blackbox testing], wrote Windows Application and Services to increase my efficiency. I also worked closely with Dev team and assisted in a lot of debug sessions, digging through logs and Wireshark captures for year after year to locate bugs and resolve them.</p>

Currently i'm a Network Engineer and have been in that role for over 4 years now. I manage Mid Market WiFi support for a Fortune 500 company, you can imagine the never ending workload and underpay.

I manage the following: 
- Firewalls [Meraki MX, Junper SRX, Zyyxel USG]. 
- [WLC] Wireless LAN Controllers [Ruckus SmartZone, Ruckus ZoneDirector, Ruckus Unleashed, Aruba Central, Aruba Mobility, Aruba and Ruckus local Clusters]. 
- [APs] Access Points [Aruba, Meraki, Ruckus]. 
- Client Gateways [Nomadix].

I have worked on the following: 
- Radius Authentication issue. 
- [RF] Radio Frequency issues with WiFi 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, resolved very complex issues with relation to interference, signal converge and other client issues. 
- VPN [Virtual Private Network] tunnels to our managed equipment. 
- [Landing Pages | Captive Portals] > basically the page that pops up when you connect to WiFi at a hotel, airport, caf√©, resort, etc. 
- Python scripting, automating tasks. Not in the job description but when you have to work with an insane number of devices, it just make more sense. 
- Troubleshooting OSI [L1, L2, L3] with on site staff or dispatched Techs. 
- Process RMA, place Inventory Requests, write SOW for Tech dispatches, work with OEMs.

I have a major intrest in Cyber Security and Security research, this is a decade long interest, I have been trying to make the time to gain more skills and knowledge in this space and have been doing that for the past couple of years.

I have always created Internal documentations and articles to help others better understand processes, I was never tasked or asked to do any of that but I always felt like I can help others so they don't have to go through the same struggles I had to when I started.

I have too many interests, some of those are in Technology, Security, Networking, research and Engineering, I have a nonstop desire to know all of those things so I can have a better understanding of how all those points interact with each other, a part of what I call [building the logic, my logic], this is exactly what I use in solving any problem regardless of how much I know or don't know about it, that's why research is very a important skill to have. I try to stay as humble as I can with my knowledge simply because I know that no matter how much I learn, I will never know it all. Plus, there will always be someone that possesses a skill that I don't have or I am not as good them at that specific skill, it keeps me motivated to keep going.
