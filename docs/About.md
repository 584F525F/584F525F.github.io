Graduated as a Software Engineer, worked as a Support Engineer for 5 years Installing Call Center solutions, configuring Windows Servers, Installing, configuring and Administering SQL Server Databases, QA [White & Blackbox testing], wrote Windows Application and Services to increase my efficiancy. I also worked closely with Dev team and assisted in a lot of debug sessions, digging through logs and Wireshark captures for year after year to locate bugs and resolve them.

Currently i'm a Network Engineer and have been in that role for over 4 years now. I manage Mid Market WiFi support for a Fortune 500 company, you can imagine the never ending workload and underpay.
I manage the following:
- Firewalls [Meraki MX, Junper SRX, Zyyxel USG].
- [WLC] Wireless LAN Controllers [Ruckus SmartZone, Ruckus ZoneDirector, Ruckus Unleashed, Aruba Central, Aruba Mobility, Aruba and Ruckus local Clusters].
- [APs] Access Points [Aruba, Meraki, Ruckus].
- Client Gateways [Nomadix].
I have worked on the following:
- Radius Authentication issue.
- [RF] Radio Frequency issues with WiFi 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, resolved very complex issues with relation to interference, signal coverge and other client issues.
- 

I have always created Internal documentations and articles to help others better understand processes, I was never tasked or asked to do any of that but I always felt like I can help others so they don't have to go through the same strugles I had to when I started.

I have too many intrests, some of those are in Technology, Security, Networking, research and Engineering, I have a nonstop desire to know all of those things so I can have a better understanding of how all those points interact with each other, a part of what I call [building the logic, my logic], this is exactly what I use in solving any problem regardless of how much I know or don't know about it, that's why research is very a important skill to have.

I try to stay as humble as I can with my knowledge simply because I know that no matter how much I learn, I will never know it all. Plus, there will always be someone that posesses a skill that I don't have or I am not as good them at that specific skill, it keeps me motivated to keep going.
