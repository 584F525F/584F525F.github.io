<p>Graduated with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineer, worked as a Support Engineer for 5 years Installing Call Center solutions, configuring Windows Servers, Installing, configuring, and Administering SQL Server Databases, QA [White & Black box testing], FTP Servers, VDIs, VMs, wrote Windows Applications and Services to increase my efficiency. I also worked closely with the Dev team and assisted in countless debug sessions, digging through logs and Wireshark captures year after year to locate bugs and resolve them, some of the protocols I worked with at the time are UDP, RTP, SIP, Skinny, H323.</p>

I then worked as a Network Engineer for almost 5 years, during that time, I managed mid-market WiFi support for a Fortune 500 company, you can imagine the never-ending workload and underpay. Some of what I managed,

- Firewalls [Meraki MX, Juniper SRX, Zyxel USG].
- [WLC] Wireless LAN Controllers [Ruckus SmartZone, Ruckus ZoneDirector, Ruckus Unleashed, Aruba Central, Aruba Mobility, Aruba and Ruckus local Clusters]. 
- [APs] Access Points [Aruba, Meraki, Ruckus]. 
- Client Gateways [Nomadix].

I also worked on the following:

- Radius Authentication issue. 
- [RF] Radio Frequency issues with WiFi 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, resolved very complex issues with relation to interference, signal coverage, and other client issues. 
- VPN [Virtual Private Network] tunnels to our managed equipment. 
- [Landing Pages | Captive Portals] > Basically the page that pops up when you connect to WiFi at a hotel, airport, caf√©, resort, etc. 
- Python scripting, automating tasks. Not in the job description but when you have to work with an insane number of devices, it just makes more sense. 
- Troubleshooting OSI [L1, L2, L3] with on-site staff or dispatched Techs. 
- Process RMA, place Inventory Requests, write SOW for Tech dispatches, and work with OEMs.
- Firmware upgrades and patching.
- Setting up VLANs, DHCP Servers, DNS, DDNS.

As of 12/23/2024, I am now a Reliability Engineer under SIRE (Service Innovation & Reliability Engineering). This a a newly established role in this Org and they are still figuring out what we are going to be doing on this role. Considering that we manage sensitive traffic over Data Centers, things I would be responsible for would be related to catching things before they turn into a bigger problem, such as: Latency, Jitter, Packet Loss and more.

I have a major interest in Cyber Security and Security research, this is a decade-long interest, I have been trying to make the time to gain more skills and knowledge in this space and have been doing that for the past couple of years.

I created Internal documentation and articles to help others better understand processes and fix complex issues, I was never tasked or asked to do any of that but I always felt like I could help others so they don't have to go through the same struggles I had to when I started.

I have too many interests, some of which are in Technology, Security, Networking, Research, and Engineering, I have a nonstop desire to know all of those things so I can have a better understanding of how all those points interact with each other, a part of what I call [building the logic, my logic], this is exactly what I use in solving any problem regardless of how much I know or don't know about it, that's why research is a very important skill to have. I try to stay as humble as I can with my knowledge simply because I am aware that no matter how much I learn, I will never know it all. Plus, there will always be someone that possesses a skill that I don't have and can learn from, it keeps me motivated to keep going.
