# BitwiseOperator XOR_ [Cyber Offensive - Pentesting Tools]

This is a list of tools that I accumulated over time while diving into Cyber Security & Pentesting. While I found some very useful repos and resources that have tools listed, I like to set things up in my own way.

I plan to update this whenever I am able to, keep in mind that one source isn't enough as we know and there are other repos that do a great job of compiling lists of tools and keep up with those lists.
