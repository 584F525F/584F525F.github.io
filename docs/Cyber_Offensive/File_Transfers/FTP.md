!!! info "FTP options"

    #### switches

    ```bash
    -4	Use only IPv4 to contact any host.
    -6	Use IPv6 only.
    -e	Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled into the ftp executable. Otherwise, it does nothing.
    -p	Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows the use of ftp in environments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world back to the client machine. Requires the ftp server to support the PASV command .
    -i	Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.
    -n	Restrains ftp from attempting auto-login upon initial connection. If auto-login is enabled, ftp checks the .netrc (see netrc ) file in the userâ€™s home directory for an entry describing an account on the remote machine. If no entry exists, ftp prompts for the remote machine login name (the default is the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which to login.
    -g	Disables file name globbing.
    -v	The verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.
    -d	Enables debugging.
    ```
